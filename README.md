## 🧠 1. Master LangChain & Gen AI — Build LLM & GenAI Apps (Udemy)

**Course Link:** https://www.udemy.com/share/10996g3@mf0kMZAq6asUN08eq9Kgfvi_jtfmPCPiYcyJTWd9hJ1xCZqVmCJxyAu-4ng097kyvQ==/

### 📘 About the Course
A hands‑on, application-driven Generative AI course focused on **LangChain**, **LLMs**, **Hugging Face**, **Vector Databases**, and end‑to‑end AI app development.  
It teaches how to integrate LLMs into real applications, build RAG systems, use embeddings, prompt engineering, document loaders, memory systems, and build complete AI tools with modern frameworks.

### 🎯 What I Learned
- Concepts of **transformers**, LLM internals, tokenization & embeddings  
- Building **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems  
- Using **LangChain**: chains, agents, memory, prompt templates, tools  
- Working with **HuggingFace models** for NLP tasks  
- Creating **production‑style AI apps** (chatbots, document-QA, summarizers)  
- Using **vector databases** such as Pinecone/FAISS  
- Deploying AI apps using **Streamlit**  
- Building over **16 practical LLM projects**
