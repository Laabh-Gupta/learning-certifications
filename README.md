  - How modern LLMs work (OpenAI, Gemini, LLAMA 2, Hugging Face models)  
  - Tokenization, embeddings, and language model reasoning  

- **LangChain Core Concepts**  
  - LLMs, Chat Models, Prompt Templates  
  - Indexes & Document Loaders  
  - Memory systems and conversational pipelines  
  - Chains & Agents for multi-step task automation  

- **Vector Databases & Retrieval**  
  - Using Pinecone to store and retrieve embeddings  
  - Building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
  - Connecting LLMs with external knowledge sources  

- **Prompt Engineering & Structured Outputs**  
  - Designing effective prompts  
  - Building controlled, consistent model responses  
  - Output parsing and response validation  

- **Practical GenAI Development**  
  - How to integrate OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google Gemini Pro  
  - Creating production-like applications using Python  
  - Streamlit interfaces for interactive AI apps  
  - Best practices for scalable LLM app development  
### 🧩 Projects
Throughout the course, I built **multiple real-world GenAI applications**, applying LangChain and LLMs to practical use-cases such as:  
- conversational agents  
- document/question answering  
- summarization  
- content generation  
- data analysis  
- workflow automation
